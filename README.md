# Saunter

Saunter is an [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi) documentation generator for dotnet.

## Getting Started

See [examples/StreetlightsAPI](examples/StreetlightsAPI).


1. Install the Saunter package

    ```
    dotnet add package Saunter
    ```

2. In the `ConfigureServices` method of `Startup.cs`, configure Saunter.

    ```csharp
    // Add Saunter to the application services. 
    services.AddAsyncApiSchemaGeneration(options =>
    {
        // Specify example type(s) from assemblies to scan.
        options.AssemblyMarkerTypes = new[] {typeof(StreetlightMessageBus)};

        // Build as much (or as little) of the AsyncApi document as you like.
        // Saunter will generate Channels, Operations, Messages, etc, but you
        // may want to specify Info here.
        options.AsyncApi = new AsyncApiDocument
        {
            Info = new Info("Streetlights API", "1.0.0")
            {
                Description = "The Smartylighting Streetlights API allows you\nto remotely manage the city lights.",
                License = new License("Apache 2.0")
                {
                    Url = "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"
                }
            },
            Servers =
            {
                { "mosquitto", new Server("test.mosquitto.org", "mqtt") }
            }
        };
    });
    ```

3. Add attributes to your classes which publish or subscribe to messages.

    ```csharp
    [AsyncApi] // Tells Saunter to scan this class.
    public class StreetlightMessageBus : IStreetlightMessageBus
    {
        [Channel("publish/light/measured")] // Creates a Channel
        [PublishOperation(typeof(LightMeasuredEvent), Summary = "Inform about environmental lighting conditions for a particular streetlight.")] // A simple Publish operation.
        public void PublishLightMeasuredEvent(Streetlight streetlight, int lumens) {}
    ```

4. Add saunter middleware to host the AsyncApi json document. In the `Configure` method of `Startup.cs`:

    ```csharp
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapAsyncApiDocuments();
    });
    ```

5. Use the published AsyncApi document:

    ```jsonc
    // HTTP GET /asyncapi/asyncapi.json
    {
        // Properties from Startup.cs
        "asyncapi": "2.0.0",
        "info": {
            "title": "Streetlights API",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "description": "The Smartylighting Streetlights API allows you\nto remotely manage the city lights.",
           // ...
        },
        // Properties generated from Attributes
        "channels": {
            "light/measured": {
            "publish": {
                "operationId": "PublishLightMeasuredEvent",
                "summary": "Inform about environmental lighting conditions for a particular streetlight.",
            //...
    }
    ```

## Bindings
Bindings are used to describe protocol specific information. These can be added by creating a Filter which will be applied to each operation during the AsyncAPI document generation.

To use a filter, create a class which implements `IOperationFilter` and register it in `Startup.cs` 

In the filter you can set custom binding information.

```csharp
public class MyCustomOperationFilter : IOperationFilter
{
    public void Apply(Operation operation, OperationFilterContext context)
    {
        // Here you have access to the generated Operation which you can modify.
        // You are also provided with the Context which contains things like the MethodInfo and Attribute
        // used to generate the Operation.
        
        operation.Bindings = new OperationBindings
        {
            Http = // set http binding info
            Kafka = // set kafka binding info
            // etc
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
services.AddAsyncApiSchemaGeneration(options =>
{
    options.OperationFilters.Add(new MyCustomOperationFilter());
});
```

Once these steps are complete, when you generate your documentation any class with a `[PublishOperation]` or `[SubscribeOperation]` attributes will have the binding information added to the documentation.


### Http Bindings

Example HTTP binding operation filter
 
```csharp
public class HttpOperationFilter : IOperationFilter
{
    public void Apply(Operation operation, OperationFilterContext context)
    {
        operation.Bindings = new OperationBindings
        {
            Http = new HttpOperationBinding
            {
                Type = "request",
                Method = "GET",
                Query = new HttpOperationBindingQuery
                {
                    Type = "object",
                    Required = new string[] { "companyId" },
                    Properties = new
                    {
                        CompanyId = new
                        {
                            Type = "number",
                            Minimum = 1,
                            Desciption = "The Id of the company."
                        }
                    },
                    AdditionalProperties = false
                },
                BindingVersion = "0.1.0"
            }
        };
    }
}
```

### Kafka Bindings
 
Example Kafka binding operation filter

```
public class KafkaOperationFilter : IOperationFilter
{
    public void Apply(Operation operation, OperationFilterContext context)
    {
        operation.Bindings = new OperationBindings
        {
            Kafka = new KafkaOperationBinding
            {          
                GroupId = new KafkaOperationBindingGroupId
                {
                    Type = "string",
                    Enum = new string[] { "myGroupId" }     
                },
                ClientId = new KafkaOperationBindingClientId
                {
                    Type = "string",
                    Enum = new string[] { "myClientId" }
                },
                BindingVersion = "0.1.0"
            }
        };
    }
}
```
