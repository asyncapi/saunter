## [Unreleased]

## [v0.4.0] - 2021-07-27
### Changed
- UI no longer proxies to playground.asyncapi.io, but instead uses the asyncapi standalone react component as an embedded resource.
- Removed settings related to the proxied UI
    - AsyncApi.Middleware.UiRoute
    - AsyncApi.Middleware.PlaygroundBaseAddress
- Bumped project dependencies 
```
System.Text.Json 5.0.0 -> 5.0.2
Namotion.Reflection 1.0.14 -> 1.0.23
Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk 16.8.3 -> 16.10.0
```


## [v0.3.1] - 2021-07-19
### Fixed
- DateTimeOffset causes recursive schema - now treated same as DateTime
- DictionaryKeyToStringConverter to support lists #94

## [v0.3.0] - 2021-07-19
### Changed
- Replaced dependency on Newtonsoft.Json with System.Text.Json
    - Previously we were inspecting types for the attributes provided by Newtonsoft.Json such as `[JsonProperty]`. If you were relying on these attributes, you will now need to set `options.SchemaIdSelector` and/or `options.PropertyNameSelector` to a function which inspects those attributes.
    e.g.
    ```csharp
    services.AddAsyncApiSchemaGeneration(options =>
    {
        options.PropertyNameSelector = prop => 
            prop.GetCustomAttribute<JsonPropertyAttribute>()?.PropertyName ?? prop.Name;
    });
    ```

### Added
- Multi-targeting `netcoreapp3.1`, `net5.0`  and `netstandard2.0`
- Async API UI
- Endpoint-aware middleware on `netcoreapp3.1`+
    ```csharp
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapAsyncApiDocuments();
        endpoints.MapAsyncApiUi();
    })
    ```
- Bindings for HTTP, Kafka & RabbitMQ
- Support for Subscribe and Publish operations of the same Channel in different classes
- Code-first discriminator support with `[Discriminator]` and `[DiscriminatorSubType]` attributes
- Support for `[Required]` attribute
- Support for Channel Parameters
- Support for `oneOf` message types (use multiple `[Message(Type)]` attributes)

### Fixed
- `AsyncApiOptions.PropertyNameSelector` was not being used


## [v0.2.0] - 2020-08-04
### Added
- Support System.Guid as a JSON Schema string with "uuid" format.
- Default Schema ID factory handles generics in a human-friendly format 
    - `List<Foo>` becomes `"listOfFoo"`
    - `Dictionary<string, Foo>` becomes `"dictionaryOfStringAndFoo"`
    - etc

## [v0.1.0] - 2020-07-02
### Changed
